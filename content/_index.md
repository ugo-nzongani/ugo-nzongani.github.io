        My main research interests are quantum walks, noisy quantum computation, quantum algorithms and optimization problems. My <a href="https://theses.fr/s373218" target="_blank">PhD research</a> aims to understand the limitations and the conditions under which noise can be used to improve quantum computation using quantum-walked based circuits. In the bigger picture we aim to apply those results to help solving hard combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers.
